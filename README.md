# naarivad.in

a youth-led organisation focusing on the upliftment of women and gender minorities in policy, society & media.

## Why does this page exist?

Our content delivery server is managed and run by our community. Therefore, a GitHub organisation seemed appropriate to store and organise our codebase.

## Our projects

- Single node content delivery server available @ https://docs.naarivad.in — Backend only. Framework: [Rocket](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket) / Rust
- Discord bot extension to monitor job statuses within the organisation — Framework: [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) / Python
