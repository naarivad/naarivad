# How to name your file to have it uploaded automatically:
- Get the link to the post you translated
  - On mobile, tap the kebab menu on the top right corner, and click copy link. The link is now in your clipboard.
  - On web: The link is in your address bar.
  
- Your link should look like this: https://www.instagram.com/p/CJqj7HQjcC5/
  In this link, the post ID is the random string of letters after the /p/ i.e. `CJqj7HQjcC5`
  
- The filename can now be constructed in the format `{post ID}_{language_code}.{extension}`
  - language code is the two letter code of the language you translated to. This can be one of `BN`, `HI`, `KA`, `PA`, `TA`, `UR` (as of now)
  - Supported file extensions are `.odt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.doc`

For example, if I wanted to post a Tamil translation of the above post in the PDF format, my filename would be `CJqj7HQjcC5_TA.pdf`

NOTE: Formats other than PDF are treated as deprecated. We urge you to convert to PDF before uploading (common document editors like Microsoft Word offer a 'save as PDF' option). 
If, for some reason, you submit any other supported format, it will be converted to PDF before being served on the main site. 
The original format will still be accessible on the docs site.

We insist on this format spec to ensure seamless integration between the maintainers of the docs server and the main website.

Cheers,
Your friendly neighbourhood overengineer.
